Calculate the average score for each student found in the dictionary.
Identify all students whose average score is 85 or higher.
Return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the student's name and their average score. This list should be sorted in descending order based on the average score. If two students have the same average score, their relative order in the output list does not matter.
